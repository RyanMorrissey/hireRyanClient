    <p class="mb-4">
      During covid, one of the hobbies I picked up was model painting.  What started as a way to get into a tabletop game became a nice creative outlet.  I started to buy more paints, then more models, then even more paints, and all of a sudden I had a huge supply of materials.  Painting became more fun than playing, so I focused more of my time on that.

      I then started to look into 3D printers as a way to get cheaper models, but from there discovered resin statues and larger builds.  3D printing props, statues, and terrain became more fun than collecting models.  I could work on different techniques and create some unique gifts for friends and family.

      I just moved so my painting setup is still packed so here are some pictures from my phone that I've taken over the past 4ish years.  I compressed the images and added some pagination.  I think having a kind of loading animation would be nice?  I'll look into it.
