        <p>
          Hello! My name is Ryan Morrisey, a software developer living near Albany, New York. I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2019 and have been working as a full-stack developer since 2020.  Following a company-wide layoff, I have been looking for new work as of August 2024.  Moving delayed me a bit, but I am now back to being fully focusing on finding new work.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-100 mb-4">What is this site?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When I started to look for work again, the idea of this site came to mind. I knew the concepts of building something from scratch as well as how to deploy it, but all of my professional work has been on things that had already been established.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find the best way to truly understand how something works is to do it from start to finish. While visual design is not really a strength of mine, I figure I can still put something together to explain who I am. I only had a few set goals on how I wanted to deploy it. Built with an Angular 19 frontend, a Spring backend, and a Postgres database that is all deployed in AWS.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-100 mb-4">Why should you hire me?</h2>
      <p>
        I like to try new things and I have a passion for getting things done.  I adore software development and the constant improvement one can make in this career is what makes it so enjoyable.  From that enjoyment I build enthusiasm, and that enthusiasm spreads around everyone I work with.
