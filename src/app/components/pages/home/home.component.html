        <p>
          Hello! I am a software developer living near Albany, New York. I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2019 and have been working as a full-stack developer since 2020.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-100 mt-6 mb-4">What is this site?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When I started to look for work again, the idea of this site came to mind. I knew the concepts of building something from scratch as well as how to deploy it, but all of my professional work has been on things that had already been established.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find the best way to truly understand how something works is to do it from start to finish.  While visual design is not really a strength of mine, I figure I can still put something together to explain who I am.  I only had a few set goals on how I wanted to deploy it.  Built with an Angular 19 frontend, a Spring backend, and a Postgres database that is all deployed in AWS.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-100 mt-6 mb-4">My goals?</h2>
        <p>
          To find a new home to continue my growth as a developer!  I love Software Development from the bottom of my heart and want to get back to it as soon as I can.
