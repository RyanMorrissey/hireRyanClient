# HireRyanClient

Written as a companion to HireRyanServer.
Built with Angular 19, this was an excuse to learn how to deploy a
server on AWS S3.

Turns out, building an deploying an angular app by itself is fast and cheap.
I'd like to mess around with bundling more but at its current scale its not really
necessary?  Its mostly to give my resume some additional context.  I am still learning,
so if you have any technical advice, please let me know!
